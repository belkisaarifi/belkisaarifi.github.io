                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>We are Coffee House.</p>
                    <p>In the heart of Hamburg, surrounded by brick houses and canals, we roast our coffee fresh every day using a gentle drum roasting process. The green coffee comes directly to us via the port of Hamburg.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a specialty roaster, we focus on high-quality single-origin coffees and fine coffee blends. It is important to us to be in direct contact with the local producers. We are also involved in selected projects in the growing countries to promote sustainability and fair business relationships. Responsibility for people and nature is our focus.
